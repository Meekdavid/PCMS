# Design Decisions

## Architectural Approach

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Choice**: Implemented as a monolithic application
- **Rationale**:
  - Reduced complexity for a demo project
  - Lower operational costs compared to microservices
  - Simplified deployment and testing
  - Suitable for the expected scale of the application

### Clean/Onion Architecture
- **Layered Structure**:
  1. **Presentation Layer (API)**: Handles HTTP requests/responses
  2. **Application Layer**: Contains business logic and workflows
  3. **Domain Layer (Common)**: Core business models and interfaces
  4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Cross-cutting concerns
  5. **Persistence Layer**: Database interactions

- **Benefits**:
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Improved testability
  - Flexibility to change implementations
  - Reduced coupling between components

## Core Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern
- **Implementation**:
  - Interfaces for all database operations (`IRepository<T>`)
  - Concrete implementations in Persistence layer
  - Generic base repository reduces boilerplate code

- **Advantages**:
  - Decouples business logic from data access
  - Easier to mock for unit testing
  - Centralized data access logic

### Factory Pattern for Storage
- **Implementation**:
  - `IStorageService` interface with multiple implementations:
    - `LocalStorageService` for local file storage
    - `FirebaseStorageService` for cloud storage
  - Storage factory to create appropriate instance

- **Benefits**:
  - Easy to switch between storage providers
  - Consistent interface for file operations
  - Extensible for additional storage options

## Performance Considerations

### Pagination Implementation
- **Approach**:
  - Client supplies `pageIndex` and `pageSize`
  - Parameters applied at database query level
  - `PaginatedList<T>` return type for consistent responses

- **Performance Gains**:
  - Reduced network payload
  - Faster database queries
  - Lower memory consumption

### Database Optimization
- **Indexing Strategy**:
  - Added indexes on frequently queried columns
  - Composite indexes for common query patterns
  - Regular index maintenance

- **Query Optimization**:
  - Selective column retrieval (not `SELECT *`)
  - Properly structured joins
  - EF Core query tuning

### Caching Strategy
- **Implementation**:
  - Memory caching for frequently accessed data
  - Cache invalidation policies
  - Distributed cache ready architecture

## Infrastructure Patterns

### Generic Repository
- **Implementation**:
  - `BaseRepository<T>` with common CRUD operations
  - Specialized repositories inherit from base
  - Reduces duplicate code

- **Methods Included**:
  - `GetByIdAsync`
  - `GetAllAsync`
  - `AddAsync`
  - `UpdateAsync`
  - `DeleteAsync`
  - `CountAsync`

### Unit of Work
- **Implementation**:
  - Tracks multiple repository changes
  - Single database transaction commit
  - Ensures data consistency

## Security Design

### Input Validation
- **Approach**:
  - FluentValidation for request DTOs
  - API-level model validation
  - Business rule validation in Application layer

### Audit Logging
- **Implementation**:
  - Automatic tracking of key operations
  - Timestamped records of changes
  - User context capture

## Error Handling

### Consistent Error Responses
- **Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "responseCode": "14",
    "message": "Validation failed",
    "errors": [
      "Member ID is required",
      "Amount must be positive"
    ]
  }
